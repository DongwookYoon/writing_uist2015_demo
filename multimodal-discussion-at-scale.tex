\section{Introduction}

Peer-discussion in classrooms can improve student learning outcomes~\cite{chi2014icap}, in particula, strengthening studentsâ€™ mental model about concepts~\cite{nicol2003peer} and broaden student perspectives on problem solving~\cite{smith2009peer}.
Massive open online course providers provide a large number of students with online peer discussion activities through discussion forums~\cite{mitros-6002x}, video chats, and peer feedback on assignments~\cite{mitros-linc}. These face a tradeoff between the richness of synchronous interaction and the flexibility of asynchronous interactions.

Recently, we presented a multimodal annotation system called RichReview~\cite{yoon2014richreview}.
RichReview brings expressivity into asynchronous document annotations through the use of student-recorded multimedia, including text, audio, and gestures.
The system was built for purpose of writing feedback, but was designed to supporting a range of modes of online peer-discussion.

In this work, we demonstrate how integration of RichReview into a MOOC platform can potentially open an expressive discussion channel among a large number of students.
As the first step, we re-implemented the RichReview's front-end, integrating it into Open edX -- a MOOC platform with millions of learners, including several national deploymnets. We designed a scalable back-end architecture for transmitting and storing multimedia comments created by a number of students.
We partner these with a novel peer-group assignment scheme that maximizes overall diversity of group composition using student profile data.

\section{RichReview Multimodal Annotation System}
RichReview is a tablet based multimodal annotation system for bringing richness of in-person conversation into document writing revision process.
With RichReview, a commentator can record a combination of input modalities that are available in the modern tablet computers, such as digitizer writing, voice recording, and the pen's hovering.
For example, a RichReview users can verbally explain about a math concept while pointing over a relevant formula and drawing a graph.
Moreover, apart from other anchored discussion systems, RichReview puts an annotation thread within text lines of the body passage, so that the surrounding texts could enrich the context of the comments.
A prior lab study promised potential of the rich commenting system as a supporting tool for document-centric conversation.

\section{Integration into edX.org} 

The key to success for the deployment of a courseware application is a seamless integration into the existing MOOC service platform.
As an integral part of the edX.org, we re-implemented the RichReview system as an extension of XBlocks, courseware components for authoring edX courses.
This allows the MOOC authors to include RichReview discussion sessions without having the hassles of the service management.
For example, as shown in the Figure 1, the instructor can place the RichReview discussion session within the flow of the course contents.
Note here that The RichReview XBlock serves the discussion session as an the JavaScript-based web application front-end.

\subsection{Making the Back-end Scalable}
RichReview is a media-heavy web application that frequently exchanges audio-visual data with the server.
Thus, designing a scalable back-end architecture of RichReview is essential for the large-scale deployment.
For this, we defined data elements of RichReview into the two types: heavy-load multimedia data such as audio recording and PDF documents, and lightweight metadata including textual notes and audio meta information.
Then by storing and serving the heavy-loaded data on the distributed cloud file storage---in our case, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)---that users can have direct access via web request, we could balance the data transaction load even when there are a high demand for multimedia contents from a large number of users.

\subsection{Semantic Voice Editing}
From our prior RichReview deployment study \cite{yoon2015richreview}, the discussant sometimes had to re-record entire voice only to fix a small mistake in the middle of the recording, such as a stutter or a long pause.
Recently, Rubin et al. presented an audio editing system that leverages speech transcriptions as semantic guidelines for editing voice as if it is text \cite{rubin2013content}.
We follow this semantic editing approach, but focus on design and developing live editing features, such as partial deletion or insertion.
Even after having the caption-based editing system, it is a tedious repetitive task to manually trim long-pauses and 'Um's {yoon2014richreview}.
We will solve this problem by providing a batch post-processing operation that can automatically delete such unnecessary snippets at once.

\subsection{Profile Based Group-assignment}
Assigning students to groups that can maximize overall diversity of the member compositions.
